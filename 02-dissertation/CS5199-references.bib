	abstract = {Static and dynamic power constraints are steering chip manufacturers to build single-{ISA} Asymmetric Multicore Processors ({AMPs}) with big and small cores. To deliver on their energy efﬁciency potential, schedulers must consider core sensitivity, load balance, and the critical path. Applying these criteria effectively is challenging especially for complex and non-scalable multithreaded applications. We demonstrate that runtimes for managed languages, which are now ubiquitous, provide a unique opportunity to abstract over {AMP} complexity and inform scheduling with rich semantics such as thread priorities, locks, and parallelism—information not directly available to the hardware, {OS}, or application.},

	abstract = {Modern mobile and embedded devices are required to be increasingly energy-efﬁcient while running more sophisticated tasks, causing the {CPU} design to become more complex and employ more energy-saving techniques. This has created a greater need for fast and accurate power estimation frameworks for both run-time {CPU} energy management and design-space exploration. We present a statistically rigorous and novel methodology for building accurate run-time power models using performance monitoring counters ({PMCs}) for mobile and embedded devices, and demonstrate how our models make more efﬁcient use of limited training data and better adapt to unseen scenarios by uniquely considering stability. Our robust model formulation reduces multicollinearity, allows separation of static and dynamic power, and allows a 100× reduction in experiment time while sacriﬁcing only 0.6\% accuracy. We present a statistically detailed evaluation of our model, highlighting and addressing the problem of heteroscedasticity in power modeling. We present software implementing our methodology and build power models for {ARM} Cortex-A7 and Cortex-A15 {CPUs}, with 3.8\% and 2.8\% average error, respectively. We model the behavior of the nonideal {CPU} voltage regulator under dynamic {CPU} activity to improve modeling accuracy by up to 5.5\% in situations where the voltage cannot be measured. To address the lack of research utilizing {PMC} data from real mobile devices, we also present our data acquisition method and experimental platform software. We support this paper with online resources including software tools, documentation, raw data and further results.},

Moreover, energy-efﬁciency has become the key design constraint in recent years and many works use a separate power modelling framework to evaluate energy consumption. While such tools are convenient and ﬂexible, they are known to contain sources of error which are often not fully understood and potentially impact the conclusions drawn from investigations. This work enables accurate, hardware-validated performance, power, and energy modelling of {CPUs} by ﬁrst presenting a methodology to evaluate and identify sources of error in {CPU} performance models, and secondly developing empirical power models optimised for use with such performance models. Hierarchical clustering, correlation analysis, and regression techniques are used to identify sources of error without requiring detailed {CPU} speciﬁcations and enable existing models to be improved, new models to be developed, validation of simulator changes, and testing of model suitability for speciﬁc use-cases. Furthermore, the {GemStone} open-source software tool is presented, which automates the process of characterising hardware platforms, identifying sources of error in gem5 models, applying power analysis, and quantifying the effect of errors on the performance, power, and energy estimations. In addition, the mean percentage error in execution time was found to swing from −51\% to +10\% between two versions of the same gem5 model, underlining the need for an automated tool to validate models against reference hardware, ensuring accuracy and consistency.},

	abstract = {Power modelling is important for modern {CPUs} to inform power management approaches and allow design space exploration. Power simulators, combined with a full-system architectural simulator such as gem5, enable power-performance trade-offs to be investigated early in the design of a system with different conﬁgurations (e.g number of cores, cache size, etc.). However, the accuracy of existing power simulators, such as {McPAT}, is known to be low due to the abstraction and speciﬁcation errors, and this can lead to incorrect research conclusions. In this paper, we present an accurate power model, built from measured data, integrated into gem5 for estimating the power consumption of a simulated quad-core {ARM} {CortexA}15. A power modelling methodology based on Performance Monitoring Counters ({PMCs}) is used to build and evaluate the integrated model in gem5. We ﬁrst validate this methodology on the real hardware with 60 workloads at nine Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling ({DVFS}) levels and four core mappings (2,160 samples), showing an average error between estimated and real measured power of less than 6\%. Correlation between gem5 activity statistics and hardware {PMCs} is investigated to build a gem5 model representing a quad-core {ARM} Cortex-A15. Experimental validation with 15 workloads at four {DVFS} levels on real hardware and gem5 has been conducted to understand how the difference between the gem5 simulated activity statistics and the hardware {PMCs} affects the estimated power consumption.},

	title = {Runtime Energy Management of Concurrent Applications for Multi-core Platforms},
	url = {https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/433546/},
	abstract = {Multi-core platforms are employing a greater number of heterogeneous cores and resource configurations to achieve energy-efficiency and high performance. These platforms often execute applications with different performance constraints concurrently, which contend for resources simultaneously, thereby generating varying workload and resources demands over time. There is a little reported work on runtime energy management of concurrent execution, focusing mostly on homogeneous multi-cores and limited application scenarios. This thesis considers both homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-cores and broadens application scenarios. The following contributions are made in this thesis. {\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Firstly, this thesis presents online Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling ({DVFS}) techniques for concurrent execution of single-threaded and multi-threaded applications on homogeneous multi-cores. This includes an experimental analysis and deriving metrics for efficient online workload classification. The {DVFS} level is proactively set through predicted workload, measured through Memory Reads Per Instruction. The analysis also considers thread synchronisation overheads, and underlying memory and {DVFS} architectures. Average energy savings of up to 60\% are observed when evaluated on three different hardware platforms (Odroid-{XU}3, Intel Xeon E5-2630, and Xeon Phi 7620P). {\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Next, an energy efficient static mapping and {DVFS} approach is proposed for heterogeneous multi-core {CPUs}. This approach simultaneously exploits different types of cores for each application in a concurrent execution scenario. It first selects performance meeting mapping (no. of cores and type) for each application having minimum energy consumption using offline results. Then online {DVFS} is applied to adapt to workload and performance variations. Compared to recent techniques, the proposed approach has an average of 33\% lower energy consumption when validated on the Odroid-{XU}3. {\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}To eliminate dependency on the offline application profiling and to adapt to dynamic application arrival/completion, an adaptive mapping approach coupled with {DVFS} is presented. This is achieved through an accurate performance model, and an energy efficient resource selection technique and a resource manager. Experimental evaluation on the Odroid-{XU}3 shows an improvement of up to 28\% in energy efficiency and 7.9\% better prediction accuracy by performance models.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}},

Such processors often need to execute applications concurrently, exhibiting varying and mixed workloads (e.g. compute- and memory-intensive) depending on the instruction mix and resource sharing. Runtime adaptation is key to achieving energy savings without tradingoff application performance with such workload variabilities. In this paper, we propose an online energy management technique that performs concurrent workload classiﬁcation using the metric Memory Reads Per Instruction ({MRPI}) and pro-actively selects an appropriate V-f setting through workload prediction. Subsequently, it monitors the workload prediction error and performance loss, quantiﬁed by Instructions Per Second ({IPS}) at runtime and adjusts the chosen V-f to compensate. We validate the proposed technique on an Odroid-{XU}3 with various combinations of benchmark applications. Results show an improvement in energy efﬁciency of up to 69\% compared to existing approaches.},

	abstract = {Modern heterogeneous multi-core systems, containing various types of cores, are increasingly dealing with concurrent execution of dynamic application workloads. Moreover, the performance constraints of each application vary, and applications enter/exit the system at any time. Existing approaches are not efﬁcient in such dynamic scenarios, especially if applications are unknown, as they require extensive ofﬂine application analysis and do not consider the runtime execution scenarios (application arrival/completion, and workload and performance variations) for runtime management. To address this, we present {AdaMD}, an adaptive mapping and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling ({DVFS}) approach for improving energy consumption and performance. The key feature of the proposed approach is the elimination of dependency on ofﬂine proﬁled results while making runtime decisions. This is achieved through a performance prediction model having a maximum error of 7.9\% lower than the previously reported model and a mapping approach that allocates processing cores to applications while respecting performance constraints. Furthermore, {AdaMD} adapts to runtime execution scenarios efﬁciently by monitoring the application status, and performance/workload variations to adjust the previous {DVFS} settings and threadto-core mappings. The proposed approach is experimentally validated on the Odroid-{XU}3, with various combinations of diverse multi-threaded applications from {PARSEC} and {SPLASH} benchmarks. Results show energy savings of up to 28\% compared to the recently proposed approach while meeting performance constraints.},

	abstract = {Portable, embedded systems place ever-increasing demands on high-performance, low-power microprocessor design. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling ({DVFS}) is a well-known technique to reduce energy in digital systems, but the effectiveness of {DVFS} is hampered by slow voltage transitions that occur on the order of tens of microseconds. In addition, the recent trend towards chipmultiprocessors ({CMP}) executing multi-threaded workloads with heterogeneous behavior motivates the need for per-core {DVFS} control mechanisms. Voltage regulators that are integrated onto the same chip as the microprocessor core provide the beneﬁt of both nanosecond-scale voltage switching and per-core voltage control. We show that these characteristics provide signiﬁcant energy-saving opportunities compared to traditional off-chip regulators. However, the implementation of on-chip regulators presents many challenges including regulator efﬁciency and output voltage transient characteristics, which are signiﬁcantly impacted by the system-level application of the regulator. In this paper, we describe and model these costs, and perform a comprehensive analysis of a {CMP} system with on-chip integrated regulators. We conclude that on-chip regulators can signiﬁcantly improve {DVFS} effectiveness and lead to overall system energy savings in a {CMP}, but architects must carefully account for overheads and costs when designing next-generation {DVFS} systems and algorithms.},

	abstract = {As a central part of resource management, the {OS} thread scheduler must maintain the following, simple, invariant: make sure that ready threads are scheduled on available cores. As simple as it may seem, we found that this invariant is often broken in Linux. Cores may stay idle for seconds while ready threads are waiting in runqueues. In our experiments, these performance bugs caused many-fold performance degradation for synchronization-heavy scientiﬁc applications, 13\% higher latency for kernel make, and a 1423\% decrease in {TPC}-H throughput for a widely used commercial database. The main contribution of this work is the discovery and analysis of these bugs and providing the ﬁxes. Conventional testing techniques and debugging tools are ineffective at conﬁrming or understanding this kind of bugs, because their symptoms are often evasive. To drive our investigation, we built new tools that check for violation of the invariant online and visualize scheduling activity. They are simple, easily portable across kernel versions, and run with a negligible overhead. We believe that making these tools part of the kernel developers’ tool belt can help keep this type of bug at bay.},
