I would like to thank my supervisor for helping me when I thought this project 
had crashed and burned, the gem5 developers for being friendly and providing 
fixes so that I could get the statistics and some power output working, and 
Teng Yu and Runxin Zhong for their help with understanding the ARM PMUs.
