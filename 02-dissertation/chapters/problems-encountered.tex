\begin{itemize}
    \item stats straight up not working
    \item fix was provided by gem5 devs (look up time taken)
    \item power setup not documented
    \item in fact, lots of things not documented, have to look at the source
          code
    \item dvfs documentation is out of date, so have to try to discern the
          configuration scripts
    \item power equations from gemstone applypower didn't work due to gem5
          having changed its stats interface in the meantime
    \item mention sniper sim as an attempted last resort, and how it wouldn't
          even build
