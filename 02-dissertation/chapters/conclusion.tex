\begin{itemize}
    \item gem5 is hard, not everything works as expected
    \item lots of things went wrong, but some (hopefully interesting) results 
          were obtained
    \item the ML done was not successful, but the random results show that there
          is a potential for things
    \item ideally, would take things further: more data, better ML, hardware
          implementations, etc., but time ran out
\end{itemize}
