\section{Scheduling}
\begin{itemize}
    \item scheduling has been around for a while
    \item mention that a lot will be from Silberschatz book
    \item explain basic problem
    \begin{itemize}
        \item what is a task?
        \item what is a process?
        \item what is a hw thread?
        \item what is a sw thread and why do we need them?
    \end{itemize}
    \item explain perfect way (shortest job first) and why it doesn't work
    \item mention that the problem has gotten more complex as we now have
          multicore processors and simultaneous multithreading (explain these)
    \item 
    \item explain priority scheduling and its problems
    \item explain CFS
\end{itemize}

\section{ARM big.LITTLE architecture}
\begin{itemize}
    \item what is an ISA?
    \item what is single-ISA means and why it is helpful?
    \item mention that ARM big.LITTLE is an example of this
    \item what is a big core and what is a LITTLE core?
    \item why do we have this split?
    \item mention that this poses new challenges to the already complex problem
          that scheduling is
\end{itemize}
