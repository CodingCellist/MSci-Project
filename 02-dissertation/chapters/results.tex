\begin{itemize}
    \item detail a couple of power plots
    \item mention how many runs were done
    \item explain what stats were focused on and why (PMUs!)
    \item as part of the above, include screenshots defending choice of 
          branchPred stats
    \item hopefully have some meaningful machine learning here?
\end{itemize}
